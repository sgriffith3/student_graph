# Lab Tracker
This project allows an instructor to create courses 
and track the student's completion of objectives utilizing 
a dynamically generated html table as a bar graph.

## Description
This originated out of the need for an instructor to be able
to see how far students had progressed in finishing their
assigned lab work. Currently, this works on the honor system.

As an "Instructor", you have the privileges of instantiating,
tracking, and/or deleting any course.

As a "Student" you begin by registering for your class with
your first name and your student id number. Then you are directed
to the class progress graph where you are able to update your 
own progress by simply typing in your current lab number and
selecting your status (start or end). 


### Languages/Markups used:
-HTML
-Python (Flask)
-JavaScript


#### Future Plans
This project will utilize websockets to achieve a truly RESTful interface
